You gotta know a bit of everything, even tho nodejs is backend, they can plot twist you with a frontend type questions but at a high level:

Core concepts

how does the event loop work in node.js, and how is it different from the browser?

explain the difference between process.nexttick, setimmediate, and settimeout.

what are worker threads, and when would you use them?

how does node.js handle asynchronous operations under the hood?

explain how garbage collection works in node.js.

how do streams work in node.js, and when would you use them?

what is the purpose of the cluster module, and how does it handle scaling?

Performance and optimization

how would you handle a memory leak in a node.js application?

how do you optimize a high-throughput api built with node.js?

what are the trade-offs between child processes, worker threads, and clustering?

how would you monitor and profile a node.js application in production?

what are some ways to prevent blocking the event loop?

Security

how do you prevent prototype pollution in a node.js application?

what security risks does eval() pose in a node.js app?

how do you handle jwt authentication securely in a node.js backend?

how does csrf protection work in an api, and do you need it in a restful service?

what are the best practices for handling sensitive data (e.g., env variables, secrets management)?

Code challenges / hands-on exercises

implement a custom promise class from scratch.

write a function that limits the number of concurrent asynchronous tasks running at a time.

build a simple rate limiter middleware in express.

implement an lru cache using javascript.

create an async queue that processes tasks with a given concurrency limit.

Bonus Tips

Consider free and paid alternatives with a more structured approach to prepping for frontend interviews. Full disclosure, I am the creator of FrontendLead (dot) com, which offers a structured approach to preparing for front-end specific interviews at top tech companies, with company particular questions.

Use other platforms (free and paid) to also help you prepare.

Like solving a technical problem, you should always have multiple tools in your tool belt to solve a problem.
