What kind of database would you use? Why would you pick that one? Why wouldn't you pick some others? (This is basically an SQL vs NoSQL question)

What would you expect to be the bottleneck once we hit scale? What solutions would you have to alleviate that bottleneck?

How would you go about adding permissions? What basic permissions do you think would be required for this application?

What is your philosophy on testing? What kinds of tests would you use, and what kinds would you feel more comfortable skipping?

Beyond the basics, like a backend, a frontend and a database, what other tools would you leverage? Redis? Kafka? What about database replication? Would you try to shard your database, or have read-write replicas? What sorts of factors might encourage you to use one or the other?

Explain to me what context driven testing?
I'm allways asking: what is the difference between threading and concurrency?
