Design scalable systems (think architecture tradeoffs, async patterns, clustering, message queues)

Handle performance (profiling, memory leaks, event loop blocking, DB query optimization)

Lead projects (code reviews, mentoring, writing tests, managing tech debt without slowing delivery)

Security (auth flows, OWASP basics, safe API design)

Cross-service comms (REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC, caching layers, when to use what)
