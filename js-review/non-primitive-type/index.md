Non-Primitive (Reference) Types
These are more complex data structures that can hold collections of values or more complex entities. They're stored as references.
In JavaScript:

Object - collections of key-value pairs
Array - ordered lists
Function - executable code blocks
Date - represents dates and times
RegExp - regular expressions for pattern matching
Map - key-value pairs where keys can be any type (not just strings)
Set - collection of unique values

WeakMap - Map with weak references to keys
WeakSet - Set with weak references to values
Error - error objects (and subtypes like TypeError, ReferenceError, etc.)
Promise - represents asynchronous operations
ArrayBuffer - fixed-length raw binary data
Typed Arrays - Int8Array, Uint8Array, Float32Array, etc.
DataView - interface for reading/writing binary data
Proxy - creates a proxy for another object
Reflect - provides methods for interceptable operations
